			<h2>Michael Scoville</h2>

			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this web application is to provide a place where users can quickly generate simple character sheets for use in old-styled tabletop RPGs, and then store them locally for reference.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The audience for this app is people who want a quick way to roll up characters for their games without a lot of extra hassle. Rather than creating an app that people have to download, I can just send the link to my friends and they can all access it at once without having to download anything.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>There will be a "Roll" button that will generate six random ability scores for each stat and then display them on the page by updating the DOM. The user will enter a name, select a class, and their rolled stats will all be stored as an object. This object will be saved in localStorage. A separate page (“The Tavern”) will read stored character data from localStorage and insert character cards into the page using DOM manipulation. The site will use arrays and array methods (such as forEach, map, or filter) to process the scores and information.</p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
